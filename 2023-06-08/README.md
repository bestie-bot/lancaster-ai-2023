## Simulated Environment

### Installation
From your virtual environment, you install the requirements file.
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Open up your notebook and run. Example runs straight from `VSCode`.

You'll need an OpenAI key.

Also, you can install the extension Dev Container, and once installed, open up the main repo in VSCode. Your environment will automatically be installed and you can start working.
