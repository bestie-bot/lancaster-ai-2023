## Simulated Environment

### Installation
From your virtual environment, you install the requirements file.
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Open up your notebook and run. Example runs straight from `VSCode`.

You'll need an OpenAI key.

Also, you can install the extension Dev Container, and once installed, open up the main repo in VSCode. Your environment will automatically be installed and you can start working.

You may need to rebuild your Dev Container. Hit ctrl-shift-p or command-shift-p, select `Dev Containers: Rebuild Dev Container`

To start the notebook, from your VSCode prompt in your notebook, type `jupyter notebook`, and click on the link that has a token at the end of it, so something like: `http://localhost:8888/?token=cba815a1d6d1f70af206a166fc5ac47f3a659a912f33f722`. That should open up a browser with your notebooks ready to be clicked on.
